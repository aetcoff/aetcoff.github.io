          Finding my passion has always been a struggle for me. Throughout college, I had a tough time nailing down what I wanted my focus of study to be. Ultimately, I chose Marketing because I knew a business degree would benefit me in some way in the future. Right out of school, I began working as the Marketing Director for an AT&amp;T franchise. During my time there, I discovered a love of Graphic Design through experimenting with the company's website and store collateral. This discovery led me to change directions in my life and go back to school to explore the world of design. While in Design School, I was lucky enough to be hired on as an intern at Zappos! After a few weeks of work, I realized that learning on the job was far more impactful than the classes I was enrolled in. So it wasn't a tough decision to drop out of the design program and devote all my time to being a Graphic Designer at Zappos. After six amazing months, having fallen head over heels for the company, I was hired on full-time in the Visual Design Department.

          Around six months ago, I experienced a mini life crisis. I know, it sounds dramatic, but we've all been through it at one point or another, right? I realized I wanted more out of my career but wasn't sure what I wanted or how to go about it. All I knew was that if I was going to make the jump into a new career, I wanted to make sure it was something that would be challenging, rewarding, and ultimately make me happy. At this time, an experimental group was being rolled out at Zappos called That All May Code. In a nutshell, the group's purpose was to enable those interested in code a span of time during the week to devote to learning code. I started attending these meetings because they gave me the chance to revisit my interest in web design from my previous job. It didn't take long for me to figure out the type of opportunity this skill presented for me. After many conversations with family and friends, I realized that my new career path was going to lead me into the world of code. Becoming a developer would allow me to leverage my design background while building web sites and applications. Knowing that these two skill sets would pair well with each other, and ultimately benefit me in the future, were all I needed to make up my mind. With this new vision in mind, I approached my current boss and potential future boss, separately to discuss my options. I went into both meetings not knowing what to expect and found that both were in full support of my journey! After sorting out the logistics with them, we created a special plan outside the norm. I started my unofficial mentorship that allotted me a certain number of hours per week to work directly with FEZ (Front End Development). During that time period, I could ask questions, self-teach and shadow. The mentorship was a huge learning experience. It was like being back at school once again, but being responsible for my time and education. There were a lot of frustrating days that made me second-guess my choice to become a developer. I quickly learned the importance of celebrating the small victories because frustration is just part of the journey into a new career. Although I found the mentorship extremely difficult, the time flew by and before I knew it, it was time for my coding challenge. No matter how many times I was reassured that I would do fine, I still felt massive anxiety about taking the challenge. This was my final test - one that would not only define what I do, but also what kind of person I am.  After isolating myself in a room for 3+ hours, I finally completed and submitted my final work. My mind was racing, "What did I get myself into? Would I really be able to pull this off? Will people actually respect me as a developer?" It didn't take long before they got back to me. I DID IT! They informed me that although my code wasn't the prettiest or even functional, they were most interested in how I went about problem solving. At that moment, the idea of being a developer was no longer just an idea, it had become a reality. I finally felt that my hard work had paid off and there was no better feeling than that.

          Fast forward to today - I'm officially a Front End Developer! On a typical day, I go home feeling as though I've filled my brain to full capacity. I've never been so mentally challenged in a job, and I love (mostly) every bit of it. I wish I could list out each and every person that helped me along my journey, but I believe that you all know who you are.  This entire transition has been a huge learning experience for me. The biggest lesson I learned is that it is NEVER too late to change paths in life. You only have one life to live, so make the very best of it! Challenge yourself and stay positive! Seek encouragement when you need it, and never be ashamed to ask questions. I often relied on inspirational quotes to keep my head in check during my journey, and I'll leave you with one of my favorites: "Be strong. You never know who you are inspiring." unknown.
